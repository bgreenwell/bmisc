================================================================================

This package contains some random (but hopefully useful) functions that I have
used frequently over the years. Some functions may seem unuseful, and were
created purely for practice or enjoyment. If you have suggestions for further
improvements, please submit them. Also, please report any bugs that you come 
across.
